# Shared Task
This dataset was used as part of the shared task for the [Creative-Summ](https://creativesumm.github.io/) workshop at COLING 2022. A revised version of the novel chapter summarization task can be found at the associated [repository](https://github.com/fladhak/creative-summ-data/tree/main/booksum).
